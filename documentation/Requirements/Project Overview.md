The goal of this project is to develop a secure job searching platform using Java 17, Maven, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Thymeleaf. The platform will enable users to search for job positions and apply to them, while job providers will be able to create and post job listings. The application will also incorporate Spring Security to protect REST API endpoints and ensure that only authenticated users can access specific resources.
