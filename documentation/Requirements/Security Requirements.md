## User Authentication

-   Users should be able to create an account with a unique username and a strong password.
-   Passwords should be securely stored using encryption techniques.
-   Users should be able to reset their passwords in case they forget them.
-   Implement measures to prevent common authentication attacks such as brute force attacks and credential stuffing.

## Role-based Access Control

-   Implement role-based access control to differentiate between job seekers, job providers, and administrators.
-   Define specific access levels and permissions for each role.
-   Ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions or access restricted resources.

## Secure Communication

-   Implement HTTPS protocol to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.
-   Use secure protocols and libraries for handling sensitive data, such as passwords and personal information.
   
## Input Validation and Sanitization

-   Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
-   Implement server-side validation to complement client-side validation and prevent tampering with requests.
    
## Data Privacy

 -   Ensure that sensitive user information, such as passwords and personal data, is stored.
