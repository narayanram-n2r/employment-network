## Introduction

Ngrok is a powerful tool that allows you to create secure tunnels to expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet. It simplifies the process of testing webhooks, APIs, or any other server application that needs to receive requests from external sources.

## Installation

1.  Visit the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2.  Download the ngrok binary appropriate for your operating system.
3.  Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

## Getting Started

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you extracted the ngrok binary.
3.  Start ngrok by running the following command:

`./ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`

Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with your ngrok authentication token. You can find this token on your ngrok account dashboard.

4.  To expose a local server, use the following command:

`./ngrok http PORT_NUMBER`

Replace `PORT_NUMBER` with the port number of your local server that you want to expose. By default, ngrok will create a secure HTTP tunnel.

5.  Ngrok will generate a temporary URL that maps to your local server. You will see an output similar to:

```python
Session Status         online
Account                your-name (Plan: Free)
Version                x.x.x Region United States (us)
Web Interface          http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding             http://randomstring.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER 
Forwarding             https://randomstring.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER
```


6.  You can now use the ngrok URL (`http://randomstring.ngrok.io`) to access your local server from external sources. Any requests made to the ngrok URL will be forwarded to your local server.

## Additional Features (Acknoweldge code owner)

Ngrok offers various additional features and customization options. Some useful features include:

-   HTTPS tunnels: Use the `https` command instead of `http` when starting ngrok to create an HTTPS tunnel.
-   Custom subdomains: You can reserve a custom subdomain by signing up for a paid ngrok plan.
-   Authentication: Secure your ngrok tunnels using HTTP basic authentication.

For more information on using ngrok and its advanced features, refer to the official [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).

## Conclusion

Ngrok is a valuable tool for testing and debugging server applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily expose your local server to the internet and streamline your development workflow.

Remember to handle ngrok's security implications with caution, as exposing local servers can pose risks if not properly secured.
