To automate the build, test, and deployment process of your application using Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

-   A Spring Boot Maven application hosted on GitHub.
-   Access to a Jenkins server with administrative privileges.
-   A GitHub account with administrative access to the repository.
-   The necessary plugins installed in Jenkins (such as Git plugin, Maven plugin, and Pipeline plugin).

## Set up Jenkins

1.  Install Jenkins on your server by following the official documentation: [Jenkins Installation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).
    
2.  Set up the necessary plugins in Jenkins. Go to "Manage Jenkins" → "Manage Plugins" → "Available" and search for the following plugins:
    
    -   Git plugin
    -   Maven Integration plugin
    -   Pipeline plugin
    
    Install these plugins and restart Jenkins.
    
3.  Configure Jenkins to work with Git. Go to "Manage Jenkins" → "Configure System" and locate the "Git" section. Provide the necessary Git executable path and configure global credentials to access your repository.

## Configure GitHub Actions

1.  Create a new file called `.github/workflows/main.yml` in the root directory of your GitHub repository.
    
2.  Add the following content to `main.yml`:
```yml
name: CI/CD with Jenkins

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and test
        run: mvn clean install

      - name: Deploy to Jenkins
        uses: appleboy/jenkins-action@v0.1.0
        with:
          url: http://jenkins-server-url
          username: ${{ secrets.JENKINS_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.JENKINS_PASSWORD }}
          job: Your-Jenkins-Job-Name
```

- Replace `http://jenkins-server-url` with the URL of your Jenkins server. Also, make sure to replace `Your-Jenkins-Job-Name` with the name of your Jenkins job that deploys the Spring Boot application.
    
3.  Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Create Jenkins Pipeline

1.  Open Jenkins and create a new pipeline job.
    
2.  In the pipeline configuration, locate the "Pipeline" section and choose "Pipeline script" as the definition.
    
3.  In the "Pipeline" script area, provide the Jenkinsfile content similar to the following:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git` with the URL of your GitHub repository.
    
4.  Save the pipeline configuration.

## Test the CI/CD Pipeline

1.  Make changes to your Spring Boot application code and commit them to the main branch.
    
2.  GitHub Actions will detect the changes and trigger the workflow defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.

3.  The workflow will perform the following steps:
    
    -   Checkout the code from the repository.
    -   Build and test the application using Maven.
    -   Deploy the application to Jenkins using the `appleboy/jenkins-action` GitHub Action.
4.  The `appleboy/jenkins-action` GitHub Action will send a request to your Jenkins server, triggering the Jenkins job configured in the workflow.
    
5.  Jenkins will execute the pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile:
    
    -   It will clone the repository.
    -   Build the application using Maven.
    -   Run tests on the application.
    -   Deploy the application using Maven.
6.  Monitor the Jenkins job console output for any errors or failures.
    
7.  If the pipeline completes successfully, the Spring Boot application will be built, tested, and deployed to the configured environment.
